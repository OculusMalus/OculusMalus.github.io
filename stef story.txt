My name is Stephanie. Twenty years ago I studied electrical engineering at Kansas State University and University of Arizona. I worked as a design technician for an electrical component manufacturer. I chose to become a homeschooling mother and spent the last twenty years raising and teaching my children. I found myself raising these children alone and needed to find a way to support them and give them a future. DevCodeCamp is my second chance to have a fullfilling career and provide for my family.
